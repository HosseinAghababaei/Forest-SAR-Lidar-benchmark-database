# Forest-SAR-Lidar-benchmark-database
This benchmark dataset comprises pre-processed Sentinel-1 PolInSAR images annotated with forest height information derived from space-based LiDAR data. The SAR data are provided as geocoded 4Ã—4 polarimetric-interferometric covariance matrices, which highlight key features sensitive to forest structure and height.
